It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. These type of devices are part of the "quantified self" movement -- a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data

Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

Mean and median number of steps taken each day

Time series plot of the average number of steps taken

The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps

Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data

Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed

Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends

All of the R code needed to reproduce the results (numbers, plots, etc.) in the report

Question 1 
Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
Clear the workspace
rm(sum_data)

Compute the means of steps accross all days for each interval
mean_data <- aggregate(activity$steps, 
                       by=list(activity$interval), 
                       FUN=mean, 
                       na.rm=TRUE)

Rename the attributes
names(mean_data) <- c("interval", "mean")

head(mean_data)
Compute the time series plot
plot(mean_data$interval, 
     mean_data$mean, 
     type="l", 
     col="blue", 
     lwd=2, 
     xlab="Interval [minutes]", 
     ylab="Average number of steps", 
     main="Time-series of the average number of steps per intervals\n(NA removed)")



Question 2
Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
The 5-minute interval that contains the maximum of steps, on average across all days, is 835.

The number of NAâ€™s is 2304.


Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
Compute the total number of steps each day (NA values removed)
sum_data <- aggregate(activity$steps, by=list(activity$date), FUN=sum)

Rename the attributes
names(sum_data) <- c("date", "total")

Compute the histogram of the total number of steps each day
hist(sum_data$total, 
     breaks=seq(from=0, to=25000, by=2500),
     col="blue", 
     xlab="Total number of steps", 
     ylim=c(0, 30), 
     main="Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day\n(NA replaced by mean value)")
     
The mean and median are computed like

mean(sum_data$total)
median(sum_data$total)
These formulas gives a mean and median of 10766 and 10766 respectively.

These values differ greatly from the estimates from the first part of the assignment. The impact of imputing the missing values is to have more data, hence to obtain a bigger mean and median value.
